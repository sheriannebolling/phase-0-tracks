1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

Command:
SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

Output:
1|4|Beautiful location|1|1|1|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
2|1|Damaged my car|2|2|2|Mandy|Kaling|2|Amir's Towing
3|3|Good vibe|3|3|3|Angela|Jolie|3|The Beagle Nightclub
4|5|Very peaceful|4|4|4|Steven|Wonder|4|Lotus Yoga

2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

Command:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars,reviews.comment  FROM reviews JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

Output:
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|4|Beautiful location
Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|1|Damaged my car
Angela|Jolie|The Beagle Nightclub|3|Good vibe
Steven|Wonder|Lotus Yoga|5|Very peaceful

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

Command:
SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id WHERE businesses.name = "Lotus Yoga";

Output:
4|5|Very peaceful|4|4|4|Steven|Wonder|4|Lotus Yoga
