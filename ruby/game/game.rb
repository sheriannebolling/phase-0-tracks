# Outside class
	# Input: Word given by user and guesses by second user
	# Create a while loop that allows the user to guess until there are no guesses left.
	# Output: Message congratulating or taunting

# Create a class 
	# Create a variable to hold the word user-1 enters. 
	# Create a variable to hold the guess user-2 enters - The variable should store the guesses
	# Create a variable that counts the number of guesses
		# Create a method to create a new variable that holds an array of letters of the word user-1 enters.
		# Create a method to create another array of "_" that matches the length of the word.
		# Create a method to check if guess matches
			# If guess matched any of the letters of the  word(using iteration) change the index in 
			# the _ variable to that letter. 
		# Create a method to count
			# If the guess doesnâ€™t match a previous guess the count goes down by one
			# If the guess matches a previous guess the count does not go down.
			# Prints to try again they have already guessed that letter
		# Create a method to print 
			# Print array on one line with spaces.
			# Print new version of array after each guess
		# Create a method to check if win
			# If the new array is equal to the array of the word variable then display 
			# congratulatory message if not a taunting message.
