# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system that manages different versions of a project. It records changes and allows you to keep versions organized. It is useful because it allows you or multiple people to work on different pieces of a project at the same time without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes. Since it records changes you can restore work and more easily see where a problem may have begun. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a separate version of a master file that allows you to work, edit, and make changes while keeping the integrity of the master file. You would use one because it acts as a backup in case you make a mistake. You can play with and test code without it changing the master file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point to record progress. A good commit message explains the changes that have been made and is detailed.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when changes are made and while merging your system does not know which change or if a change is correct. This can happen when changes are made to the same file for example if two people change the same line to different code.
