Plan to learn JQUERY

1. Find resources:
	Short videos
	Short tutorials 
	Cheat sheet

2. Watch the videos

3. Do the tutorials


I like watching videos when I am first learning about something as an introduction because they are usually less indepth and get me more interested in the topic. They are also usually easy to understand and allow me to see the bigger picture. I do however typically learn best by reading and then trying what I have read so this will be my main approach. Short tutorials are usually good because they are specific and focused. Writing things out helps me to make sure I understand what I have learned.   

I will break to test myself every half hour. I find this to be a good amount of time to spend on one subject for me and then test myself before I move on. 

I find its very important to take some sort of break at least once an hour even if it is just a short stretch or walk. I know it's not good to sit for long periods of time, so I try to make sure I do this. 


Strategies I found effective:

I had no problem finding resources, there were plenty to chose from.

So my initial idea about watching videos did not pan out as easily as I thought it would. Most of the videos I found were either super long or it seemed like they tried to cram the info into a short time period by speaking really quickly which just confused me. I looked at multiple videos and they all sped through at a pace that didn't give me the basics or an overview. I felt like I was wasting time just looking at videos, so I decided to move on. 

I found a few really great tutorials that in addition had cheat sheets and other resources listed. This really worked for me. I went through andn learned as much as I could and I really felt like I gained a lot from it. I also did some quizzes I found online and made sure that I was able to retain what I learned.
